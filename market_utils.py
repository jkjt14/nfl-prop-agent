"""Utilities for working with Odds API market keys.

The Odds API exposes player prop markets using compact identifiers such
as ``player_pass_yds`` or ``player_reception_tds`` while projection
providers often publish columns with longer names like
``player_pass_yards`` or ``player_receiving_touchdowns``.  To keep the
agent flexible across the different naming schemes we treat these
variants as synonyms.  This module exposes helpers to map between the
representations and to locate the appropriate projection column for a
given market.
